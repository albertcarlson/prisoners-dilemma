This is a repo inspired by simulating the prisoner's
dillema, using different strategies, based on what I
watched in this [this Veritasium video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM&t=995s).

This video, in turn, was based on Robert Axelrod's
research, which you can read more about [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Axelrod).
